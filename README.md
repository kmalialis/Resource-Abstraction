# Resource-Abstraction
**Resource abstraction** aims at solving multiagent congestion / resource management problems by allocating the available resources into abstract groups. This abstraction creates new reward functions that provide a more informative signal to the reinforcement learning (RL) agents and aid the coordination amongst them.
